#Why would anyone make such a stupid thing?

I need blocks to automatically capture and retain dispatch_group_t’s such that the groups have lifetimes at least as long as those of the blocks. This was the path of least resistance.

#Do I need this?

Probably not. There are other solutions that are often more convenient. If you’re using [RXFutures](https://github.com/robrix), however, you might find that this helps you ensure that your cancellation/completion handlers can interact safely with libdispatch objects without jumping through hoops or trying to force some ordering on said handlers.
